It builds on a previous classification developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) known as the Coding System of Trade Control Measures and was developed by several international organizations forming the Multi-Agency Support Team, commonly known as the MAST group. This group was set up to support the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-tariff Barriers established by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD in 2006. The final proposal of the MAST group was revised by UNCTAD and all relevant divisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Secretariat and tested for data collection in the field by the International Trade Centre and UNCTAD. The work resulted in the 2012 version of the publication. The classification is considered to be an evolving one, adaptable to the reality of international trade and data collection needs.\nThe MAST group, which discussed and proposed this classification, is composed of the following organizations: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Trade Centre, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), UNCTAD, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, World Bank and WTO.\nRevision of the classification leading to the 2019 version: International Classification of Non-\ntariff Measures\nTo address the growing complexities of international trade, the MAST group, other experts and \ngovernment officials refined the 2012 version from 2015\u20132018. The group revised existing chapters A to I and chapter P and worked on the definition and taxonomy of the classification for chapters J to O, which lacked a disaggregated taxonomy. The MAST group created six open working groups to address the following areas:\n1  UNCTAD, 2010, Non-tariff Measures: Evidence from Selected Developing Countries and Future Research Agenda \n(United Nations publication, New York and Geneva), p. 99.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2610, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c0dfee8-56ba-4dea-b67e-399feb86794e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c0dfee8-56ba-4dea-b67e-399feb86794e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75997e67-9737-49be-a62f-107839132bed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "0f31fe2971d7af1a9c1febb6c544fcfb229271b2616048c9db1eec2ed6f82517", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "vi 2019 VersionINTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF NON-TARIFF MEASURES\n(a) General issues: chapters A to I and chapter P; working group chaired by UNCTAD;\n(b) Post-sales services and distribution restrictions: chapters J and K; working group chaired by \nthe World Bank;\n(c) Subsidies: chapter L; working group chaired by WTO;\n(d) Government procurement: chapter M; working group chaired by OECD; \n(e) Intellectual property: chapter N; working group chaired by UNCTAD;\n(f) Rules of origin: chapter O; working group chaired by the International Trade Centre.\nThe groups interacted regularly, and progress was presented annually to a wider audience at the UNCTAD \nNon-tariff Measures Week and MAST meeting, as well as at other trade and regulator meetings. The revised version was adopted by all working groups in 2018/2019.\nThe work on the chapter dealing with government procurement coincided with efforts by OECD on the \ndevelopment of a taxonomy of measures affecting government procurement as part of its own work programme.\n2 Given the commonalities between the projects of the MAST group and those relating to \nthe OECD government procurement classification, both groups worked together closely to develop a government procurement taxonomy. The World Intellectual Property Organization contributed to the chapter on intellectual property, and the World Customs Organization, to the chapter on rules of origin.\nBecoming an international classification of the United Nations Statistical Commission\nIn December 2019, the Wiesbaden Group on Business Registers, Committee of Experts on Business and \nTrade Statistics and Inter-Agency Task Force on International Trade Statistics endorsed the International Classification of Non-tariff Measures in a joint report (E/CN.3/2019/1). In March 2019, the United Nations Statistical Commission endorsed the classification for data collection across countries and for reporting on internationally comparable data on non-tariff measures.\nClassification structure\nThis classification comprises technical measures, such as sanitary or environmental protection \nmeasures, as well as others traditionally used as commercial policy instruments. These include, for example, quotas, price control, export restrictions and contingent trade protective measures, as well as other behind-the-border measures, such as competition- and trade-related investment measures and government procurement or distribution restrictions. \nThis classification does not judge on the legitimacy, adequacy, necessity or discrimination of any form of \npolicy intervention used in international trade. It acknowledges the existence of policy intervention and is designed to set information out in a database format. Transparent, reliable and comparable information can contribute to an understanding of the phenomenon and help exporters worldwide to access \n2  J Gourdon, V Bastien and L Folliot-Lalliot, 2017, OECD taxonomy of measures affecting trade in government \nprocurement processes, OECD Trade Policy Papers, No. 198 (OECD Publishing, Paris).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3055, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c29c249-df1c-413b-a6d5-6881e7673eb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c29c249-df1c-413b-a6d5-6881e7673eb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "22b40fa6-3cfa-4f45-bbeb-973dba4e2df9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "651ca007b6695c42d654ef18999e71a9d4ed76567221fa9d23abf332b1dab6f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "vii 2019 VersionIntroduction\ninformation, as is the case with tariffs. Transparent information is also needed for any negotiations that \ncould lead to harmonization and mutual recognition and thus enhance trade.\nThe classification develops a tree/branch structure whereby measures are divided into chapters, \ndepending on their scope and/or design. Each chapter is further differentiated into several subgroups to allow a finer classification of the regulations affecting trade. The International Classification of Non-tariff Measures consists of 16 chapters (A to P), and each chapter is divided into groupings with a depth of up to three levels (one, two and three digits, following the same logic of the Harmonized System (HS) Nomenclature for product classification). In addition, measures are listed by number in each subgroup; the digit 9 is reserved for all cases not listed within that subgroup. Although a few chapters reach the three-digit level of disaggregation, most of them stop at two digits. The chapters, listed in the following table, reflect the requirements of the importing country concerning its imports, with the exception of measures imposed on exports by the exporting country (chapter P).\nClassification of non-tariff measures by chapter\nImportsTechnical\nmeasuresA Sanitary and phytosanitary measures\nB Technical barriers to trade\nC Pre-shipment inspection and other formalities \nNon-\ntechnical\nmeasuresD Contingent trade-protective measures\nE Non-automatic import licensing, quotas, prohibitions, quantity-control measures and \nother restrictions not including sanitary and phytosanitary measures or measures relating to technical barriers to trade\nF Price-control measures, including additional taxes and charges\nG Finance measures\nH Measures affecting competition\nI Trade-related investment measures\nJ Distribution restrictions\nK Restrictions on post-sales services\nL Subsidies and other forms of support \nM Government procurement restrictions\nN Intellectual property\nO Rules of origin\nExports P Export-related measures", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2048, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc7347ed-2dfa-4172-a717-95d30a0ca5d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc7347ed-2dfa-4172-a717-95d30a0ca5d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12d20761-0978-4d9e-8846-02253e511587", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "89fcc71389e04c04532cd2bfb51a6dd75347e6adab9b9c70e294e56b0b0125b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "viii 2019 VersionINTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF NON-TARIFF MEASURES\nChapter A deals with sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The chapter outlines measures such as \nthose restricting substances, ensuring food safety and preventing the dissemination of diseases or pests. Chapter A also includes all conformity-assessment measures related to food safety, such as certification, testing and inspection, and quarantine. \nChapter B provides a collection of technical measures, also called technical barriers to trade. The \nchapter describes measures relating to product characteristics such as technical specifications and quality requirements; related processes and production methods; and measures such as labelling and packaging in relation to environmental protection, consumer safety and national security. As in the case of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, chapter B includes all conformity-assessment measures related to technical requirements, such as certification, testing and inspection. \nChapter C, the last chapter in the technical measures section, classifies the measures related to pre-\nshipment inspections and other customs formalities.\nChapter D groups contingent measures, that is, those measures implemented to counteract the \nadverse effects of imports in the market of the importing country, including measures aimed at tackling unfair foreign trade practices. These include anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard measures. \nChapters E and F  feature the \u201chard\u201d measures that are traditionally used in trade policy. Chapter E \nincludes licensing, quotas and other quantity-control measures, including tariff-rate quotas. Chapter F \nlists the price-control measures that are implemented to control or affect the prices of imported goods. Among the examples are those measures designed to support the domestic prices of certain products when the import prices of these goods are lower, to establish the domestic prices of certain products because of price fluctuation in domestic markets or price instability in a foreign market and to increase or preserve tax revenue. This category also includes measures other than tariffs measures that increase the cost of imports in a similar manner (para-tariff measures).\nChapter G lists the finance measures. The chapter outlines measures restricting the payments of \nimports, for example when the access and cost of foreign exchange is regulated. It also includes measures imposing restrictions on terms of payment.\nChapter H includes those measures affecting competition \u2013 those that grant exclusive or special \npreferences or privileges to one or more limited group of economic operators. They are mainly monopolistic measures, such as State trading, sole importing agencies or compulsory national insurance or transport.\nChapter I deals with trade-related investment measures and groups the measures that restrict investment \nby requiring local content or requesting that investment be related to export in order to balance imports. \nChapters J and K  relate to the way products \u2013 or services connected to the products \u2013 are marketed \nafter being imported.

These measures can be considered restrictive when their purposes or effects limit or prevent competition by protecting domestic suppliers. Many of these practices are commonly used and referred to in international instruments such as the Revised Agreement on Government Procurement of WTO and the Model Law on Public Procurement of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (2011). The classification is based on the assumption that a country conducts open tendering, whereby all interested suppliers may submit a tender. If a country conducts tendering in a different manner, non-tariff measure codes M52\u2013M55 would apply.\nM51 Design of procurement methods\nAny particularity in the scheme of contracts such as the division of contract into lots (allotment). These specific measures may limit competition (for example, by excluding procurements from the application of certain rules or trade agreements) and lead to less visibility of the call to foreign suppliers, for instance when dividing a large contract into small parts to accommodate small and medium-sized enterprises.\nExample:  The allotment (i.e. division of contracts) mechanism designed to \nencourage the participation of national suppliers is mandatory.\nM52 Registration (supplier registration system)\nProcess whereby any supplier seeking to tender is required to register and \nprovide certain information. This first registration process may be carried out by the procuring entity or by another public entity (for example, registration with the Ministry of Commerce). A supplier can submit its tender only upon completion of the registration process. Registration may involve a simple mechanism for the identification of suppliers.\nExamples:  Foreign bidders must be registered in the bidders\u2019 national record. \nRegistration must be renewed before the fifth working day of April each year.\nM53 Shortlist/pre-selected list of suppliers", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2404, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed0ea1c6-08eb-4fec-a6fc-7527462593b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed0ea1c6-08eb-4fec-a6fc-7527462593b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c687c73-cc9c-43ae-944d-5b29bb1af4bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "35b9ecfbb2039839497a74adf9964377e6eec3e67fa05d2f01aa9ec81b34eed8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "M\n57 2019 VersionM.

However, for efficiency purposes, the time period should not be excessively long.\nExample:  The minimum time period to submit a tender is seven days.\nM59 Conduct of procurement not elsewhere specified\nM6 Qualification criteria\nRequirements that are used by a procuring entity to determine the eligibility of suppliers to \nparticipate in government procurement opportunities.\nM61 Certification or licence criteria\nCertification or licence requirements beyond the regular professional qualifications required to perform a given activity.\nExample:  All suppliers will have to submit minority economic empowerment \nrating certificates issued by verification agencies approved by the country\u2019s \naccreditation system.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1945, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "127cd8d4-aef5-4a95-9b5f-7c288a65b753": {"__data__": {"id_": "127cd8d4-aef5-4a95-9b5f-7c288a65b753", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af7149e0-265c-46a1-a10d-d6f62de4a710", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "4b75c8a3ac30202f91024f621fa2bfdf63594b6b08582f88f598998ab7f33bc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "M\n59 2019 VersionM.  Government procurement restrictions\nM62 Set-asides for specific groups (small and medium-sized \nenterprises, minorities)\nMeasures whereby a procuring entity reserves procurement opportunities, often \nsmaller procurements, only for specific groups.\nExample:  Any purchase by the federal government that has an anticipated value \nabove the micropurchase threshold of $3,500 is required to be automatically \nand exclusively set aside for small businesses.\nM63 Past performance requirements\nRequirements to the effect that a supplier must demonstrate its previous successful performance of a similar work as a condition for participation in a procurement procedure. In the same context, a procuring entity may require that a supplier not have poor past performance. While prior experience requirements indicate that a supplier should have done similar work before, past performance requirements refer to how well a supplier should have done the work. This measure should be used with caution because verifying and measuring past performance may involve the discretion of a procuring entity. \nExample:  Suppliers having significantly or persistently deficient past \nperformance, which has led to early termination of a contract or other sanctions \nwithin three years, shall be excluded from the procurement proceedings.\nM64 Prior experience requirements\nRequirements indicating that a supplier must have previously carried out similar work. Such measures may require, as a condition for participation in a procurement procedure, that suppliers have previously been awarded procurement contracts by certain public entities within the country concerned. This may pose a significant challenge to foreign suppliers. First, a requirement of having worked in relation to a procuring country would limit the new entry of foreign suppliers into the procurement market, even if they have gained relevant prior experience in similarly conditioned countries. Second, excluding suppliers from the competition would undermine the competitive environment of the government procurement system in a procuring country. \nExample:  Suppliers for construction procurement must have prior experience \nin building similar types of buildings in a procuring country. Prior experience in \nother countries is not taken into account.\nM69 Qualification criteria not elsewhere specified", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2373, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b1fdad1-e083-46ca-9c6b-12389a470d30": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b1fdad1-e083-46ca-9c6b-12389a470d30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af138124-2103-44b9-9f52-396bfcbef77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "5977da2d1d8cff14e176a23a44f43adad73757f7bfc4831afafb66ac479e4e65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "60 2019 VersionINTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF NON-TARIFF MEASURES\nM7 Evaluation criteria\nCriteria used by a procuring entity to select a successful bidder\nM71 Technical contractual conditions\nTechnical specifications that may be geographically specific or not aligned \nwith international standards (where such exist) or which would impose a disproportionate compliance burden or cost on non-national suppliers.\nExample:  Technical specifications must be drafted in such a way as to promote \nlocal products or specific suppliers.\nM72 Financial contractual conditions \nThis measure includes restrictions on the terms of payment.

To acquire a trademark, enterprises may have to file at a national trademark office though a trademark agent, or through regional and international application procedures. To maintain a trademark, enterprises may have to pay annual maintenance fees. Normally, after seven years, the trademark holders would need to request renewal of the trademark registration, failing which, the trademark could expire.\nN2  Exhaustion \nConditions under which intellectual property rights can no longer be enforced.\nOnce an intellectual property right holder or its licensee has marketed a product protected \nby intellectual property rights, the right to control the sale or distribution of the product is said to be exhausted, i.e. it can no longer prevent the subsequent re-sale of the product.\nThis section registers the legal framework in each country and for each intellectual property \ncategory without assigning the product that it covers.

RULES OF ORIGIN\nRules of origin cover laws, regulations and administrative determinations of general application \napplied by the Governments of importing countries to determine the country of origin of goods. Rules of origin are important in implementing trade policy instruments such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties, origin marking and safeguard measures.\nExample: Machinery products manufactured in a country face difficulty in fulfilling the rules of \norigin to qualify for the reduced tariff rate of the importing country, as the parts and materials \noriginate in different countries.\nO1  Preferential rules of origin\nLaws, regulations and administrative determinations of general application by a Government to determine whether goods qualify for preferential treatment under contractual or autonomous trade regimes leading to the granting of a tariff rate that is different from the applicable most favoured nation tariff.\nPreferential rules of origin are included in preferential trade agreements and unilateral trade \npreference schemes to determine when an import is deemed to originate in a country that has received preferences under a preferential trade agreement.\nO11 Origin criterion\nA test that defines the origin of a good. A good is either wholly obtained in the country where most or all of its inputs and processing originate, or, when inputs or manufacturing steps originate in more than one country, the country where a substantial transformation occurs. A substantial transformation may be defined either as an ad valorem percentage, a change in tariff classification or a specific working or processing requirement. \nOften, countries extend the list of countries whose inputs or manufacturing \nsteps can be used to fulfil substantial transformation requirements in countries other than the exporting country. Such extensions are called accumulation or cumulation and are usually applied across sectors or agreements. \nO111 Wholly obtained\nOrigin status conferred to a good that is entirely or largely produced or manufactured in one country without using non-originating materials.\nExample:  Live animals born and raised in one country and vegetables \nthat have been grown and harvested in one country are considered \nto be wholly obtained.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2343, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ced8c6c6-9539-472f-9bcb-9c0fa8b5664f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ced8c6c6-9539-472f-9bcb-9c0fa8b5664f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98ef42e9-29f0-4f52-82d3-307239394ed6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2019d5_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2482379, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "b12e28069f6dbc5ea884b405f31abda8d198db93db5e67aac9b8634e0967ed03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "O\n71 2019 VersionO.

Introduction and purpose\nIn recent decades, multilateral and regional trade negotiations and unilateral liberalization have substantially \nreduced tariff rates. Non-tariff measures (NTMs), however, represent a growing challenge for exporters and policy makers. The ability to gain and to benefit from market access depends increasingly on compliance with trade regulatory measures such as sanitary requirements and goods standards. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has been actively involved in research and activities on issues related to non-tariff measures. In 1994, UNCTAD began to collect and classify the measures. While the UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) remains the most comprehensive database on the measures, it has required substantial improvements to keep up with the increasing complexity of and need for data. To develop a strategy to reduce the transparency gap, in 2006, UNCTAD established the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-Tariff Barriers, composed of leading economists from international organizations. A Multi-Agency Support Team (MAST group) provided substantial support. As a result, the Transparency in Trade initiative was launched by UNCTAD, the African Development Bank, the International Trade Centre and the World Bank. UNCTAD leads international efforts to collect data on the measures.\nThe collection of these data requires the classification of legal documents (regulations, directives, rules \nand the like) by appropriate predefined codes. These codes are provided in the publication International \nClassification of Non-Tariff Measures.\n1\nThe classification of the measures was developed and agreed by several international organizations in the context of a multi-agency initiative led by UNCTAD (MAST group: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Trade Centre (ITC), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), UNCTAD, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO)) and international experts. The classification is designed to facilitate the collection, analysis and dissemination of data on the measures, with the final objective of increasing transparency and understanding about the subject. \nA recurring problem for data collectors, who collect and classify trade-related regulations into non-tariff \nmeasures data, is that regulations on the measures are often based on legal and/or technical terms which may render it difficult to univocally assign the most appropriate code. For data collectors, some interpretation is often required when classifying the measures described in the legal documents and regulations according to the predefined codes. \nThe purpose of this manual is to provide guidelines to enable data collectors to harmonize the data \ncollection process and to minimize uncertainty during the process of categorization and classification. In doing so, the manual presents the logic behind the classification of non-tariff measures, and it explains how to choose the most appropriate code. This manual provides a large set of examples, and it is regularly updated to respond to queries and questions emerging during the data collection exercise. This 2023 version updates the last version prepared in 2021. \nThis manual has been created with the intention of covering as many cases as possible. However, if \nuncertainties persist, data collectors are encouraged to submit their questions to ntm@unctad.org, \nproviding also a copy of the legal text and stating the proposed code.\n1 UNCTAD (2019), International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures, 2019 Version.\n1 1.

Non-tariff measures: definition and general \nconsiderations\nDefinition\nThe concept of non-tariff measures is neutral and does not imply a direction of impact or legal judgment. \nThey are defined as \u201cpolicy measures, other than customs tariffs, that can potentially have an economic effect on international trade in goods, changing quantities traded, or prices or both\u201d.\n2 Non-tariff barriers \n(NTBs) are a subset of the measures, implying a negative impact on trade. The measures are normally collected through UNCTAD\u2019s TRAINS Data Entry Tool and disseminated through its TRAINS Dissemination Portal, the World Integrated Trading System (WITS) and the Global Trade Helpdesk (GTH). The TRAINS database also includes measures from other sources. \nUnderstanding the meaning of the terms \u201cregulation\u201d and \u201cmeasure\u201d\nA regulation is a legal document issued officially by a Government, such as a law, decree or directive. An official regulation could include several measures (or NTMs). \nFor the purpose of the classification, a measure is a mandatory trade control requirement enacted by an \nofficial regulation. Each regulation or legal document must be read to distinguish all measures within its text. All identified measures should be registered separately. \nIn the database of non-tariff measures, both regulations and measures must be recorded precisely \nand fully to reflect the information embedded within the legal document which is relevant to the trade requirements. Descriptions of both the regulation and the measures within the regulation is required. At the moment, UNCTAD\u2019s database of non-tariff measures is mostly available in English. If the regulation is already in English and a description of the regulation is readily available, a simple copy of the description of the regulation in the database is sufficient. The same principle applies for the measures. If the regulation is in another language, a description of the regulation and of each measure in the original language has to be provided, to be accompanied by a translation of the description into English.\nWhat data are collected? \nThe data that are collected are official measures currently imposed by the country and that affect imported or exported products. As a rule of thumb, such measures would be checked at the customs point to allow entry or exit. All specific import/export requirements are recorded in detail and with full reference.\nCollected data comprise \u201cbehind the border\u201d sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS measures) and \ntechnical barriers to trade (TBTs) that are imposed for objectives that are not primarily trade-related: for example, human, plant and animal health, and the protection of the environment. Even if equally applied to domestic producers, they nevertheless regulate international trade and are thus considered non-tariff measures.\nAccording to the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) definition, compliance with standards is voluntary. \nThey are not registered. However, some national official legislation may use the word \u201cstandard\u201d in relation to mandatory requirements, or otherwise use standards as a reference. In this case, the measure is collected and registered in the database, as it is a condition for importation.\n2 As defined by the Multi-Agency Support Team and the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-Tariff Barriers.2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3429, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b395289-1aa5-43fd-a94b-e91acbe02ae1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b395289-1aa5-43fd-a94b-e91acbe02ae1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bdf4624d-83f0-435f-807a-71dec5b44fa0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "3aec4f54302a474da3b2d8d7cef73df4e17224b5dcf185a7f1220a3371ab6142", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "What data are not collected? \na. Voluntary measures are not included in this database. One example is that of private standards \u2013 \nrequisites put forward by private organizations, such as retail companies, are not collected. \nb. International standards are not included either, unless they have been made explicitly mandatory. International standards are issued by international organizations, such as the International Organization for Standardization, CODEX Alimentarius, the International Electrotechnical Commission or ASTM, and no country is forced to adopt them. Even if countries are encouraged to follow them, they are at liberty to set a level higher or lower. For this reason, they are not included in this database. However, if a country adopts an international standard, it becomes national legislation and it is then included in the database.\nc. Data collected for the database concern only trade in goods and exclude measures affecting trade in services. The only exception is the case where the service activities are directly connected to the trade of goods (such as the case of post-sale services, chapter K). in this case, there are restrictions on the ability of exporters to provide post-sale services through their preferred or desired channels in the importing country. Even though the restrictions only concern domestic post-sale services, they negatively affect importers of products such as industrial machinery and are considered non-tariff measures.\nd. Data collected for the database concern only national-level measures, not those of a country\u2019s administrative divisions or autonomous provinces/territories. A regulation issued by Guadeloupe, for instance, should not be recorded as an official requirement set by France. This also excludes internal circulation within a country, i.e. between states within a country: these are not considered \nnon-tariff measures. For example, if the Ministry of Agriculture requires a permit to import vegetable grains, this is considered a non-tariff measure. However, if it specifies that all vegetable grains, when circulated from one province to another, need to carry an attestation of conformity with an internal taxes department, then the requirement concerns only internal trade, and it is not a non-tariff measure. Companies may add that information after import. \ne. Regulations on activities which are unrelated to trade are also outside the scope of the data collection. A regulation might eventually affect trade indirectly, but if there is not a direct connection to a requirement or condition for import/export, then the regulation is not considered a non-tariff measure. For example, a regulation might state that an individual, in order to operate a vessel/aircraft, needs to acquire a certificate of airworthiness/operation permit. This is a requirement which affects a particular activity (operating a vessel/aircraft), which might eventually affect the import of vessels or aircraft (if the certificate is very difficult to obtain, the demand for the products might decrease). However, there is no direct connection between the activity and trade of the products related to such activity. Another example is the requirement to have a driving license for cars. Such a requirement may have an effect on the demand for cars and thus on trade in cars. However, the importer is allowed to import cars even if the staff do not have driving licences. \nf. When a regulation clearly states that the importation of the products is solely for the purpose of scientific research or a trade fair, such measures are not covered.  \nFor example, the Ministry for Primary Industries issued an Import Health Standard for Laboratory \nAnimals and Laboratory Animal Germplasm detailing requirements that must be met to import animals and germplasm into the country for laboratory purposes. These requirements are not collected. Other similar examples are the importation of certain CITES samples to be used in laboratory experiments, or samples of certain food products to be used in a trade fair. These requirements do not cover normal trading activities and thus are not collected. The same is valid for restrictions on services related to the traded goods. For example, restrictions on cross-border \n3 2.

Identify regulations from each document or source\nb) Classify and register the information\n3. Identify and classify measures within each regulation\n4. Identify and classify affected products for each measure\n5. Identify and classify affected countries for each measure\n6.

The first two steps systematically register the origin of information. These steps are essential to make sure \nthat the data is traceable and can be verified and updated. Considerable efforts are made to emphasize the comprehensiveness of the data collection. Consequently, all import and export requirements are registered in the database, irrespective of complexity or stringency.\nThe remaining steps identify and classify all the relevant information from each legal text. Considerable \nwork goes into ensuring the comprehensiveness of the data collection. All import and export requirements are thus registered in the database. Figure 1 illustrates the components and dimensions of steps 4 to 6. A regulation may include one or more measures. Each one has to be classified according to the International Classification.

The data will then be ready for publication.\nIn the following sections, further details are provided on each step of the data collection process.\n3.1 Identify sources of information\nThis first step may vary according to the country concerned. In some countries, the information may be \navailable at a centralized location, where one official source compiles all legal measures. In others, the information needs to be obtained from different locations/institutions.\n(a) Centralized sources\nIn many countries, an official journal regularly publishes new laws, regulations, acts, decrees and the like, the information being contained in one publication, irrespective of the government department and the subject covered. Such centralized sources facilitate the task of data collection and continuous updates.\nExamples of countries using an official journal or other centralized source are the member States of the Latin American Integration Association. Examples of the publication titles are as follows:\n- Argentina: Bolet\u00edn Oficial (Official Journal);- Plurinational State of Bolivia: Circular de la Aduana Nacional de Bolivia (Circular of the National \nCustoms Office of Bolivia);\n- Brazil: Edi\u00e7\u00f5es Aduaneiras \u2013 Publica\u00e7\u00f5es sobre Com\u00e9rcio Exterior and Di\u00e1rio Oficial da Uni\u00e3o\n(Custom Editions \u2013 Publications on International Trade and Official Journal of the Union);- Colombia: Diario Oficial (Official Journal);- Ecuador: Registro Oficial (Official Registry);- The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela: Gaceta Oficial (Official Gazette).\nSome countries compile all their current regulations in a centralized register or code, where they may be \nconsulted. Some examples, among others, are: \n- The United States of America publishes daily the Federal Register.\n3 There is also the Code of Federal \nRegulations,4 which consolidates the regulations that are currently in force. The latter codes by subject \nall general and permanent rules of the Federal Register.\n- Australia: The Federal Register of Legislation is the authorized whole-of-government website for \nCommonwealth legislation and related documents in Australia. It contains the full text and details of the lifecycle of individual laws and the relationships between them. Notably, it contains \u201cconsolidated\u201d version of the regulations, which means that they already include all the amendments in the published document. The Legislation Register is managed by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.\n5\n3 Available at www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/FR/ \u00a0(accessed 1 October 2023).

The text of some general laws only provides generic provisions or empowers institutions to impose actual regulations or requirements. Such laws are usually followed up by more detailed regulations that should be registered in the database.\n3.3  Identify and classify measures within each regulation\nAll measures contained within each regulation need to be identified and classified. The legal text has to be transformed into a database format. The database should clearly reflect the following elements: \n\u2022  Which measure?\u2192\nClassify the measure identified according to the UNCTAD International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures;\n\u2022  Which product?\u2192\nFind Harmonized System codes or predefined group codes for the product(s) affected by this measure;\n\u2022  Which partner?\u2192\nAssign country/region codes to the countries affected by this measure;\n\u2022  Which objective?\u2192\nCategorize the reason why the measure was imposed, but only if it is officially stated in the regulation.\nSections 4 and 5 below provide guidelines on how to use the International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures (step 3).

User guide to coding measures\nThe following are guidelines for assigning a code to a non-tariff measure identified in the text of a regulation. \nThe first step is to be familiar with the classification of measures and to understand the basic structure of the classification as well as the different chapters.\n4.1  Structure of the classification of the measures \nMeasures are organized in various chapters by type (boxes 1 and 2).

This is the first \ndistinction that needs to be made when classifying a measure. \nAll chapters from A to O reflect the requirements of the importing country. Only chapter P comprises \nexport measures, which refer to requirements imposed solely by the exporting country on its own exports. \nAll measures imposed by the importing country, regardless of whether they are executed or verified in \neither the exporting or the importing country, are considered import measures, since they relate to the importation of the product. \nExample: For a regulation stating \u201cImports of products of animal origin into country A must be accompanied by a health certificate signed by the representative of the competent authority in the exporting country certifying that the products in question are suitable to be exported to country A\u201d, this measure must be assigned a code under the import measures of country A, as it is a requirement of the importing country.\n8For more information on the classification, see UNCTAD (2019), International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures, Version \n2019.\n9 4.

Non-technical measures are subdivided into 12 chapters (D to O). Export measures comprise only one chapter (P). Box 1 summarizes the measures included in each chapter.\nBox 1. Brief description of each chapter in the classification\nChapter A on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, refers to measures affecting areas such as restrictions for \nsubstances, hygienic requirements or other measures to prevent dissemination of diseases. It also includes all conformity assessment measures related to food safety, such as certification, testing and inspection, and quarantines. \nChapter B on technical measures, refers to measures such as labelling and other measures to protect the \nenvironment. It also includes conformity assessment that relates to technical requirements such as certification, testing and inspection.\nChapter C classifies the measures related to pre-shipment inspection and other formalities performed in the \nexporting country prior to shipment.\nChapter D refers to contingent measures, which are measures implemented to counteract particular adverse \neffects of imports in the market of the importing country, including measures aimed at unfair foreign trade practices. They include antidumping, countervailing and safeguards measures.\nChapter E includes licensing, quotas, and other quantity control measures, group measures that have the \nintention of limiting the quantity traded, such as quotas. It also covers those licences and import prohibitions \nwhich are unrelated to sanitary and phytosanitary measures or technical barriers.\nChapter F includes price-control measures, which are those implemented to control or affect the prices of \nimported goods in order to, inter alia, support the domestic price of certain products when the import prices of these goods are lower; establish the domestic price of certain products because of price fluctuation in domestic markets, or price instability in a foreign market; or to increase or preserve tax revenue. This category also includes measures, other than tariff measures, that increase the cost of imports in a similar manner (para-tariff measures).\nChapter G concerns finance measures, referring to measures restricting payments for imports \u2013 for example, \nwhen access to and the cost of foreign exchange are regulated. This chapter also includes restrictions on the terms of payment.\nChapter H concerns measures affecting competition. These measures grant exclusive or special preferences \nor privileges to one or more limited groups of economic operators. They refer mainly to monopolistic measures, such as State trading, or sole importing agencies, or compulsory use of national services or transport.\nChapter I concerns trade-related investment measures, group measures that restrict investment by requiring \nlocal content or requesting that investment be related to export to balance imports. \nChapter J includes distribution restrictions, referring to restrictive measures related to internal distribution of \nimported products.\nChapter K concerns restriction on post-sale services \u2013 for example, restrictions in the provision of accessory \nservices. \nChapter L contains measures that relate to subsidies that affect trade.\nChapter M contains government procurement restriction measures and refers to the restrictions bidders may \nencounter when trying to sell their products to a foreign Government.\nChapter N concerns restrictions related to intellectual property measures and intellectual property rights. Chapter O on rules of origin, groups the measures that restrict the origin of products, or their inputs.\nChapter P includes export measures, grouping the measures a country applies to its exports. It includes \nexport taxes, export quotas or export prohibitions.10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4112, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77dd6c45-0c08-462b-8c61-23c88b229c2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "77dd6c45-0c08-462b-8c61-23c88b229c2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0f89991-7edb-4b06-b04e-75725035bee5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "58d8ba290e9cdf1aa70c9215ef0123e8572817f833669be73bc33e827d0013dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(c) Tree structure\nEach chapter (one digit, letters A\u2013P) is divided into groupings using a tree/branch structure with depth of \nup to three additional levels (two, three and four digits).

In principle, each measure is to be assigned no more \nthan one NTM code. \n(b) One regulation imposing several measures falling under the same code\nAs a rule of thumb, if a regulation imposes a set of similar requirements that would be classified under the same code, they are registered only once as a single measure. The respective products are thus jointly entered under this measure.\nExample 1: If a regulation specifies several \u201cmaximum residue limits\u201d of different chemicals for a variety of food products (for sanitary and phytosanitary reasons, NTM code A21), the measure is registered just once, and all affected products are listed under the same measure.\nExample 2: If a regulation specifies a list of items to display on the product label, the code for labelling \nis used only once. A country might require all packaged food to be labelled with nutritional information on how much fat, protein, energy, carbohydrates, and salt are in the product, the percentage of key ingredients, and all of the main ingredients that may cause allergies. These requirements are not to be coded multiple times but once under the NTM code for labelling. \nHowever, if a regulation imposes several rather distinct measures under the same code, they should be registered separately. This is the case if the respective measures differ with respect to their type or implementation. The following examples should illustrate these two cases:\nExample 1 \u2013 different type: A regulation states that imported glass windows need to fulfil the standards on energy performance (including solar heat gain and air leakage rate). They also need to be made of materials that are safe for customers\u2019 health. In this case, the regulation requires the glass windows to meet (i) quality or performance requirements (energy performance) and (ii) safety requirements (materials safe for customers). Since they are substantially distinct types of measure, they should be registered as two separate measures (both with the code B7).\nExample 2 \u2013 separate implementation: A regulation requires a standard SPS certificate for all imported \nfood products. In a different paragraph, the regulation also demands a special microbiological health certificate for fishery products. Both certificates are classified as \u201ccertification requirement for SPS reasons\u201d, A83. Given that both certificates are obtained separately, with a different set of procedures and probably from different institutions, they are registered separately. In this way, the double certification of fishery products is also reflected in the database.\nIt is crucial that the differences between measures with the same NTM code be clearly indicated in the \u201cDescription\u201d field in the \u201cMeasure Classification\u201d form of the TRAINS Data Entry Tool. Furthermore, the \u201cLocation(s) in the Regulation (reference)\u201d field in the \u201cMeasure Classification\u201d form also helps to distinguish measures contained in the same regulation. The \u201cLocation(s) in the Regulation (reference)\u201d is the specific text within a regulation (for example, a section or paragraph) where each measure is described, and it should be registered in the corresponding field.\n(c) Different regulations imposing the same measure\nIf two separate regulations impose measures that are different but would be assigned the same code, the measure code is registered twice, each with its corresponding official regulation. 12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3638, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e39b536-454f-4e3d-bbcc-2788d28198f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e39b536-454f-4e3d-bbcc-2788d28198f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8137d64e-a52c-4b88-b45f-df07d55552c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "d9a5a5c6fc0701f720d1c38fa5ce3c436d630b92bdf20616401db7546c12b73f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Example: Regulation A imposes that the weight of the product be put on a label, and regulation B \nrequires that the fat and sugar content must also be indicated on the product. In this case, the code B31 is registered twice, once under each regulation.\nThe idea behind this is that a separate and new requirement is assumed to be a new requirement that companies need to comply with, and this needs to be reflected in the database as a new entry.\nShould two separate regulations jointly define or refer to exactly the same measure, the measure is \nonly registered once under the most specific and trade-related regulation. If the two regulations are not related, the title of the other regulation may be indicated in the \u201cNotes\u201d field next to the main regulation. If the two regulations are related, for example, a decree or a circular illustrating or giving more details on a requirement stated in a general law, then the general law should be listed in the field \u201cSupporting Regulations\u201d while the decree/circular should be listed in the field \u201cLead Regulation\u201d. Two examples shall illustrate which regulation should be registered:  \nExample 1: A general phytosanitary law empowers a country\u2019s ministry of health to publish regulations on the maximum residue limits of fertilizers in imported agricultural food products (Regulation 1). The ministry then publishes such technical regulations with detailed residue limits for various food products (Regulation 2). The measure A21 is then registered under the latter technical regulation, as it is more specific and still trade-related. In this example, the latter technical regulation (Regulation 2) is listed in the field \u201cLead Regulation\u201d, while the general phytosanitary law (Regulation 1) is listed in the field \u201cSupporting Regulations\u201d.  \nExample 2: A decree (Regulation 4) requires that imported food products need to follow a pre-existing \nnational norm (Regulation 3) which until then only regulated national production. While the pre-existing national norm is more specific, it is not trade-related in itself. Therefore, the import-related decree (Regulation 4) is to be registered as the main regulation (in the field \u201cLead regulation\u201d), with the national norm (Regulation 3) being indicated in the \u201cNotes\u201d field.  \nThe main point is that two different regulations referring to the same requirements are to be registered \nbut once, under the name of one of them, not separately.\nIf another regulation is issued (Regulation 5), which mentions again that food products must follow \nthe same national norm, this should not be registered separately, as it refers to the same requirement, implemented in the same way, even if it is quoted by another legal text, probably from another ministry.\n(d) Conformity assessment measures are registered together with the corresponding technical \nrequirement\n\u201cConformity assessment\u201d (A8 and B8) is a verification process that accompanies a technical requirement and is intended to prove compliance (figure 3).\nFigure 3.

Normally, the regulation lists both. In this database, both are registered. \nExample: Raw hemp and hemp seeds for sowing are subject to a system of checks to verify that their tretrahydrocannabinol content does not exceed 0.2 per cent. This is registered both as code B21, \u201ctolerance limits for residues of or contamination by certain substances\u201d, and B82, \u201ctesting requirement\u201d. \nIn some cases, although there is a requirement, no mandatory test or certification is required. In that case, only the technical requirement is registered in the database. \nOn the contrary, conformity assessment requirements are coded together with the technical requirement.It is also possible that that a regulation states only that a conformity assessment has to be performed but \nwithout specifying the exact underlying technical requirements. In many such cases, the regulation either refers to further forthcoming regulations or indicates that a given domestic institution will be responsible for defining both technical requirements and conformity assessment procedures. These subsequent and more detailed technical regulations must then be identified and registered instead of the general regulation introducing them.  \nIf these more detailed regulations cannot be found, it is necessary to contact the authorities or implementing \ninstitution for clarification. There are three scenarios: \n(i) If the authorities provide the missing specific regulations, they should be registered;\n(ii) If the authorities indicate that there are no further technical regulations and that no conformity assessment is performed, no measures should be registered;\n(iii) If the authorities confirm the application of the general law without further detailed regulations, it is permissible to register the respective conformity assessment (codes within branches A8 and B8) without the underlying technical requirements.\nHowever, the source of such additional enquiries should be clearly indicated in the notes field.\n(e)  Leading and supporting measures: only the leading measure is registered \nOne regulation may list several measures, which normally have to be registered in the TRAINS Data Entry Tool as separate measures. However, it may be that one measure can be considered a leading measure, while others are measures supporting the same purpose. The data collector needs to register the leading measure only. These cases are rare, though. The key rule of thumb by which to distinguish leading measures from supporting measures is that when a leading measure is removed, then all supporting measures will automatically disappear.\nThe challenge is that the text of the regulation does not normally distinguish explicitly between leading \nand supporting measures, as all of them have equal legal importance. Therefore, it is important to identify the measure which reflects the essence of the matter and classify only that measure as the leading one.\nExample 1: When there is a quota (E2), there may also be a licence to be able to sell within the quota. Only the quota measure is registered in the database. As a rule, all licences that are meant to administer other measures are not registered.\nExample 2: Measure A12, \u201cgeographical restrictions on eligibility\u201d, implies a positive list of countries \nallowed to export, which comply with sufficient sanitary and phytosanitary safety conditions. This measure may be accompanied by a long list of requirements that need to be fulfilled by countries to 14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3771, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "691427df-e8c5-492f-8f0e-1a5bc0814530": {"__data__": {"id_": "691427df-e8c5-492f-8f0e-1a5bc0814530", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c3dab5a6-ed60-40ca-a070-1dc54d98263b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "4f38c6aaf7ae437dd19010d746dc2bf0538f39be225e716bcaeebd13b846e1a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "actually be in that positive list. These are not registered. In this case, only A12, which better describes \nthe phenomenon, should be coded.\nThere is one important exception: conformity assessment measures (A8 and B8) are not considered supporting measures and are always registered in addition to the underlying requirement (see above), as such procedures tend to be a significant burden for companies.\nExample: A regulation states that imports are authorized if a certificate is provided to the authorities proving that pesticide residues in fresh fruit are below a certain level. The leading measure is classified as a \u201ctolerance limit for residues for SPS reasons\u201d (A21). In addition, the \u201ccertification requirement\u201d (A83) is also registered because it is a conformity assessment. The word \u201cauthorized\u201d in the regulation can be misleading: it refers not to an \u201cauthorization\u201d (A14) but to an administrative procedure, which would be considered a supporting measure.\nConformity assessment measures under chapter P (export measures) follow the same principle. All measures falling under the code P16 (conformity assessments) are not considered supporting measures and are registered together with the requirements issued by the exporting country. They are not to be recorded alone without the underlying requirement.\n4.2.2  Use the most detailed code available to classify the measure\n(a)  Selecting the most detailed code within a branch \nA measure should be classified using the most detailed code. If a requirement falls under several codes, then separate measures must be registered for each of these codes.\nExample: If a regulation specifies labelling, marking and packaging requirements for sanitary and phytosanitary reasons, all three measure codes (A31, A32 and A33) must be registered as separate measures. They cannot be summarized under the aggregate code A3.\n(b) Using a more aggregated code/branch\nA higher-level code should only be used if a regulation does not provide enough information to assign the measure to a more disaggregated level.\nExample: A regulation generically indicates \u201cprice setting by the authorities\u201d for an imported good. Lacking more details, it must be classified as \u201cadministrative measures affecting customs value\u201d (F1). The classification F1 is further broken down into the categories \u201cminimum import prices\u201d (F11) and \u201creference prices\u201d (F12), but the regulation does not provide enough information for the coder to choose which further category to use. It should be coded as F1 because no decision can be made as to whether it will take the form of F11 or F12.\nHowever, such cases should be rare exceptions, as only precise regulations should be used for data collection (see also section 3.3).\n(c)  Using measure codes \u201cnot elsewhere specified\u201d (n.e.s.); codes ending in 9\nCodes ending in 9 are used for measures \u201cnot elsewhere specified\u201d \u2013 that is, those measures that cannot be precisely categorized within the codes provided by the classification. Such codes are found at the end of most chapters (for example, A9, B9 and E9) and branches (for example, A19, A89 and A859).\n15 4.

This requirement falls under \u201ctreatment for elimination of plant and animal pests and disease-causing organisms in the final products, or prohibition of treatment\u201d (section A5). It is not, however, \u201ccold/heat treatment\u201d (A51), \u201cirradiation\u201c (A52) or \u201cfumigation\u201d (A53). After we eliminate the options A51, A52 and A53, we are left with the sole option of coding it under A59. \n4.2.3  Only measures actually applied are registered\n(a)  Measures for potential or hypothetical situations are not registered\nPotential or hypothetical measures are not registered in the database. If a legislation only indicates that measures may be imposed in case of certain events, the measures should not be considered as actually applied and will not be registered.   \nExample: Food and agricultural products are freely imported, but a regulation says that the \u201cauthorities might suspend imports or take interim protective measures when products present any risk for public or animal health, as in the case of dangerous disease outbreaks\u201d. This is not an actual prohibition/restriction, but a possibility in case of health risks. It is thus not registered. \n(b) Measures applied at random are registered\nOn the other hand, when the legal text states that a random check is imposed, the measure is registered, because it is considered real, even if not all shipments are in fact controlled. \nExample 1: A regulation specifies a list of products that are considered \u201csensitive\u201d and others \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d. While all shipments of \u201csensitive\u201d products undergo a physical inspection, \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d products are only checked randomly. Nevertheless, the respective \u201cinspection requirement\u201d (A84 or B84) is registered to apply for both product categories.\nExample 2: in general, when legislation states that an inspection, or any other conformity assessment \nmeasure, may be applied to ensure that the product complies with the provisions of the regulation, \nthen this conformity assessment is registered in the database. \nIt is often the case that a law mentions the possibility for a certain department to implement a conformity \nassessment \u2013 \u201cMinistry of Agriculture may test the product\u201d \u2013 enabling the government institution in question to issue a specific regulation for its implementation. In this case, the data collector should register the implementing regulation that describes the test.\n4.2.4 Indicating whether measures are also applied to products that are produced and \nsold domestically\nSome non-tariff measures only affect traded goods, whereas others may also apply to products that are \nproduced and sold domestically. The variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d should be marked as \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cNot specified\u201d to indicate whether the measure is equally applied to the domestic market in the \u201cMeasure Classification\u201d form of the TRAINS Data Entry Tool.

The question about the domestic application of measures is particularly interesting for the case of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade (chapters A and B). \nMeasures that are generally applied to imported goods only (the variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d marked as \u201cNo\u201d) \nare the following: pre-shipment inspections (chapter C), contingent trade-protective measures (chapter D), quantitative restrictions (chapter E), most price-control measures and additional taxes (codes F1\u2013F6), finance measures (chapter G) and measures affecting competition (chapter H). By contrast, the definition of \u201cinternal taxes and charges levied on imports\u201d (code F7) implies that the measure is also applied domestically (the variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d marked as \u201cYes\u201d).\nExample 1: A legislative text states: \u201cThe regulations in this part prohibit or restrict the importation of certain plants, plant products and other articles to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests and noxious weeds.\u201d For all the respective measures in this part of the regulation it should be indicated that they do not affect domestic products: The variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d should be marked as \u201cNo\u201d.\nExample 2: A regulation reads: \u201cRaw livestock and poultry carcasses and parts that retain water from \npost-evisceration processing and that are sold, transported or received in commerce must bear a statement on the label in prominent letters stating the maximum percentage of water that may be retained\u201d. In this case, the labelling requirement applies to both imported and domestic products: The variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d should be marked as \u201cYes\u201d.\nFurthermore, all export-related measures (chapter P) may apply only to exports (the variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d marked as \u201cNo\u201d), but it may happen that some requirements apply to the product when it is imported, traded internally, produced nationally or exported (the variable \u201calso Domestic\u201d should be marked as \u201cYes\u201d).\n4.2.5 Comments on specific measures and wording\n(a) What is the difference between:\n(i) - Certification requirement (A83 or B83);\n- Authorization requirement for SPS/TBT reasons (A14 and B14);- Authorization requirement for importers for SPS/TBT reasons (A15 and B15);- Non-automatic import licensing (E1).\nIt is common for words such as certification, authorization, and licence to be used interchangeably in \nlegal texts. The interpretation of each concept for the collection of data on non-tariff measures is provided below.\nCertification (A83 or B83) is defined as a technical conformity assessment measure (a sanitary and \nphytosanitary measure or a technical barrier). Certificates provide proof that an individual shipment complies with specific product characteristics defined by underlying requirements. Certificates can be obtained from public or accredited private technical institutions. They are part of the documentation that a company must show at customs to be allowed to import.\nA14 \u2013 Authorization requirement for SPS reasons \u2013 must be obtained to import certain products and is \ngranted at the discretion of a public authority or under conditions that might not be disclosed. (See section 5, where it is noted that sanitary and phytosanitary measures follow certain objectives, even if there is no associated conformity assessment.)\n17 4.

This requirement is established to enforce technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures, which are about product characteristics, related processes and production methods that are mandatory. The authority may ask for several conformity-assessment procedures in relation to a given authorization requirement. (See section 5, where it is noted that technical barriers to trade must always be accompanied by conformity assessment to be in line with the WTO agreement on such barriers.)\nA15 \u2013 Authorization requirement for importers for sanitary and phytosanitary reasons \u2013 applies to the \nimporting company rather than a product. Like an authorization for product import (A14), an authorization requirement for importers is granted at the discretion of a public authority or under conditions that might not be disclosed.\nB15 \u2013 Authorization requirement for importers \u2013 also applies to the importing company, but with the \npurpose of requiring the importers to comply with relevant technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures. To be registered, importers may need to provide further documentation as proof of their compliance with certain requirements from the relevant government agency. \nWhere the authorization is granted without a conformity assessment or predefined product characteristics \nor performance requirements for the product, chapter E should be picked instead of sanitary and phytosanitary measures or technical barriers to trade.\nNon-automatic import licences (E1) fall under a different category. By definition, licences are quantitative \nrestrictions and can be applied for economic (E11), political (E122) and religious, moral or cultural (E121) reasons, as well as for environmental (E123) and security (E124) reasons or for the protection of public health (E125). Being quantitative restrictions, they are not bound to any conformity assessment with technical regulations, unlike the B14 requirement (\u201cauthorization\u201d) under chapter B, even if the objectives are sometimes the same in both cases.\n(ii) - Tolerance limit for residues (A21 and B21);\n- Restricted use of certain substances (A22 and B22).\nA tolerance limit for residues (A21 and B21), often referred to as a maximum residue limit, refers to the \npresence of contaminants that are not ingredients, such as pesticides. The \u201crestricted use of certain substances\u201d (A22 and B22) targets ingredients and additives that could be harmful or unhealthy if used abundantly, such as colourants in food. \nThe difference between A21 and A22 is that A21 sets the limit for substances which are not intended \ningredients but are used during production, while A22 sets limits on (or prohibits) certain substances which are used as ingredients in foods, feeds and their contact materials. \nSubstances limited in products covered by A21 could be fertilizers, pesticides and certain chemicals and metals in food and feed. These are substances no one would like to have in food or feed \u2013 only a small amount could be tolerated.\nSubstances restricted in products covered by A22 could be additives or sweeteners. These are \nsubstances that were added on purpose because they have some sort of beneficial effect, for taste, colour, preservation or something else. Since they could be harmful in large quantities, their use is restricted.18", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3640, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "732c6057-8bc8-438b-95c3-f8b1b25fd204": {"__data__": {"id_": "732c6057-8bc8-438b-95c3-f8b1b25fd204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24aac104-8a7a-4a8e-9ccc-423d7edf5bf7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "95857809a1ea5ee7a18e2591f08513b291e3fec0b617b4d26e29503fe693a51b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(iii) - Labelling (A31 and B31);\n- Marking (A32 and B32).\n\u201cLabelling\u201d (A31 and B31) refers to information displayed on consumer products as packaged for retail \nsale, including indications on the packaging box of individual products.\nTypical labelling requirements for food and beverage products can include one or more of the followings:\n\u2022Name of food/product;\n\u2022Country of origin of the product;\n\u2022Ingredients;\n\u2022Nutritional information;\n\u2022English language labelling;\n\u2022Food allergens; and\n\u2022Any chemicals/food additives used.\n\u201cMarking\u201d (A32 and B32) refers to information displayed on the outer transport container useful for logistics \nhandling. They could be word markings (such as \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Do not stack\u2019, \u2018Handle with care\u2019, \u2018This way up\u2019) or pictorial markings/symbols.\n(iv) - Testing (A82 or B82);\n- Inspection (A84 or B84).\n\u201cTesting\u201d (A82 or B82) is generally stricter than \u201cinspection\u201d (A84 or B84). Testing involves laboratory tests \n(for example, for chemical products) and procedures that \u201cuse\u201d (test) the product (for machines or tools). Testing or inspection may take place in the exporting or importing country. However, those measures are generally imposed by the importing country as a prerequisite for importation and therefore should be entered in the database as import measures, even when testing is performed in the exporting country. \n(v) - Product identity requirement (B6);\n- Quality/safety/performance requirement (B7).\n\u201cProduct identity requirement\u201d (B6) is used when the regulation sets the conditions that the product should \nmeet to be denominated by a certain name. If it does not comply with those conditions, the product can still be sold, but under another name. \nExample: A product should have a minimum of 80 per cent orange juice to be called \u201corange juice\u201d. If its content is lower, it may still be imported under the name \u201cfruit drink\u201d.\n\u201cProduct quality, safety or performance requirement\u201d (B7) sets the minimum quality conditions under which the product can be imported. \nExample: These include the specific red colour in tomatoes required for importation, and requirements such as durability, power consumption and size for agricultural products, or sugar content in fruit.\nHowever, \u201cproduct quality, safety or performance requirement\u201d should not be used if another code better describes the particular requirement. \nExample: A legal text may begin by generally stating that \u201cminimum quality standards have to be met\u201d. Later, the precise requirements are defined and, for example, may actually refer to maximum transport temperatures for fresh food products. Thus, the measure should be coded as \u201cstorage and transport conditions\u201d (A64).\n19 4.

A41 and A42 both cover hygienic requirements related to sanitary and phytosanitary conditions \u2013 applied either to the final product (A41) or throughout the production process (A42). \nA5 covers a set of requirements focusing specifically on the treatment for elimination of plant and animal \npests and disease-causing organisms in the final product (or prohibition of such treatment). Codes within A5 should be used only when the regulation clearly mentions treatment or prohibition of treatment. Any type of treatment other than cold or heat treatment, irradiation or fumigation should be coded under A59. Any prohibition on any type of treatment for elimination of plant and animal pests and disease-causing organisms should also be coded under A59. \nA6 covers other requirements relating to production or post-production processes which do not fall under \nA2, A4 or A5.\n(b) Misleading words\nThe use of certain words may confuse the data collector. Legislation may use some words to define legal requirements using common language in a way that does not correspond to the language used in the definition of the classification codes. The following are some examples:\n(i) Prohibition: The wording of regulations may \u201cprohibit\u201d imports if certain requirements are not met. However, if the importer or the product does comply with the requirements, the import is allowed. In this case, the actual requirement is that the import should be registered, which is not a prohibition. \nExample: A text may indicate that it is prohibited to import fish containing more than 1 \u03bcg per g of \nmercury. This is not a \u201cprohibitions for SPS reasons\u201d (A11) but a \u201ctolerance limit for residues of or contamination by certain (non-microbiological) substances\u201d (A21).\n(ii) Marking: European Union regulations often mention the European Conformity (CE) marking. \nDespite its name, the CE marking is a proof of compliance with a certification procedure. It indicates that a product has been assessed by the manufacturer and has been deemed to meet European Union safety, health, and environmental protection requirements.\n9 Therefore, it should be coded as \n\u201ccertification requirements\u201d (A83 or B83) instead of \u201cmarking requirements\u201d (A32 or B32).\n(c) Export-related measures (P)\nIf a country applies requirements to its own exports, these requirements are to be classified as export-related measures using a code from chapter P (see further note in section 4.1 (a) of these guidelines). Export measures are quite common and are almost as diverse as import-related measures. \nRequirements should be coded as export measures only when the measure/regulation explicitly specifies \nthat it applies to exports. \nChapter P covers a wide range of measures, many of which mirror existing requirements from import \nchapters of the International classification of non-tariff measures.

It includes all sanitary and phytosanitary measures and \ntechnical barriers applied to exports, which correspond to the import-related measures listed in chapters A and B.  \nAs with chapters A and B, no trade prohibition can be coded as a technical barrier to trade, although NTM \ncode P17 allows the recording of export prohibitions for SPS reasons (thus mirroring NTM code A11). \nNTM code P12 covers authorization requirements for exporters for sanitary and phytosanitary reasons \n(thus mirroring A15 and B15). \nP13 deals with production and post-production requirements to export, similar to those listed in sections \nA4, A5, A6 or B4 for imported products. P13 covers:\n\u2022Hygienic requirements for sanitary and phytosanitary reasons (see example in A4)\n\u2022Treatment for elimination of plant and animal pests and disease-causing organisms in the final products (e.g. post-harvest treatment) or prohibition of treatment (see examples in A5)\n\u2022Other sanitary and phytosanitary requirements on production or post-production (see examples in A6)\n\u2022Production or post-production processes related to technical barriers (see examples in B4)\nWhen a regulation imposes more than one of the requirements listed in those bullet points, each of the requirements must be registered separately using the code P13. \nExample 1: Exported chicken meat shall be produced in approved poultry processing plants and transported and stored below 5\u00b0C. The meat shall go under irradiation treatment before being packed for exportation. \nIn this example, there are two different requirements: treatment (similar to that of A5), and storage and transport conditions (similar to that of A64). Each of the requirements should be registered as a separate measure but classified under the same code (P13). In this example, P13 will be registered twice.\nP14 covers requirements on the quality, safety or performance of exported products, similar to the \nrequirements listed in sections A2, B2 and B7. \nUnlike chapters A and B, which list labelling, marking and packaging requirements as separate codes, \nchapter P regroups all these requirements under P15. If a regulation in the exporting country requires more than one of those requirements, each of them will need to be registered under the same code (P15). \nExample 2: For bottled beer to be exported, the bottles must be labelled in the local language and English. The beer bottles must be packed in a lot of 12 bottles per box, and clear marks that say \u201cFragile\u201d must be displayed on all sides of the box. Since there is only one code (P15) to capture the labelling, marking and packaging requirements for exported bottled beer, each specific requirement will be recorded separately in the database, as separate measures, with the same code (P15). In this example, P15 will be registered three times. \nThough we do not code ordinary import duties/tariffs, we do code export duties/tariffs which are covered by NTM code P42 on Export taxes and duties.\nSections P2 to P9 cover other export requirements outside the scope of technical sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures. \n21 4.

The data collector may also correct past mistakes and identify new sources of regulations and measures. There are four sources of variation in the data over time:\n1. New regulation: The regulation is entirely new and does not change or repeal an already existing \nregulation;\n2. Amended regulation: The regulation is an amendment modifying some information in an already existing regulation. The old measure is otherwise still in force;\n3. Repealed regulation: The regulation repeals an existing regulation. There are two cases: a regulation can simply be repealed or revoked, and all the associated measures are not in force anymore, or the \n10If the update was done several years later, it could be that some regulations were adopted after the first data collection \nand revoked before the second.

Distinguishing between sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures and technical barriers to trade\nThe difference between the chapters on sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to \ntrade might be elusive in some cases. As a rule, the principles set out in the relevant WTO agreements are respected. \nThe chapter on sanitary and phytosanitary measures covers all measures to protect human or animal \nhealth from food-borne risks, to protect human health from diseases carried by animals or plants and to protect animals and plants from pests or diseases, whether or not these are requirements related to product characteristics or their related processes and production methods.\nThe chapter on technical barriers to trade covers all technical regulations and conformity assessment \nprocedures not covered by the chapter on sanitary and phytosanitary measures (figure 4). Technical regulation is defined by the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade as a mandatory document laying down product characteristics or their related processes and production methods. Governments may introduce technical barriers for legitimate non-SPS objectives, such as national security, the prevention of deceptive practices, the protection of the environment and protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health. For a requirement to be considered a technical barrier, it must be a technical requirement or conformity assessment procedure (instituted not for sanitary or phytosanitary reasons) and have a legitimate objective such as one of those stated above. Hence, quantitative measures such as prohibition or quotas would not fall under this chapter, even if they have such a legitimate objective as protection of the environment. \nFigure 4.

While most of the measures related to food products are sanitary and phytosanitary measures, it is possible to find technical barriers to trade in food products, too, if the measure does not relate to food safety. Along the same lines, sanitary and phytosanitary measures are mostly on food products, but there could also be such measures on non-food products.\nExample of a technical barrier to trade in food: Labelling on the nutritional content of foods or a certain size for fruits is required. The measure relates to the composition or quality of food, not to health risks or diseases. It is therefore classified as a technical barrier (B31).\nExample of a sanitary and phytosanitary measures concerning non-food product: fumigation \nrequirements on all shipments to control pests hidden in boxes, even for manufactures.\nThe protection of human health can fall under the sanitary and phytosanitary or the technical barrier category depending on whether the measure relates to food, drinks or feed (sanitary and phytosanitary) or other products (technical barrier). \n275.

On the other hand, regulations which address microbiological contamination of food, s et allowable levels of pesticide or \nveterinary drug residues or identify permitted food additives, fall under the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. If packaging requirements are related to the safety of food, drinks or feed, they are classified as sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Otherwise, they are considered technical barriers. \nAlthough the two agreements do not overlap, a single government regulation may contain both sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers. \nExample: Labelling requirements for food often include both sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers (A31 and B31). Some of the information that must be included in a label usually pertains to sanitary and phytosanitary measures and some to technical barriers. A food label may include information about calories or salt content, which falls under technical barriers, and allergy warnings, which are sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

Selecting the corresponding product codes\n6.1. What is the Harmonized System?\nThe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, generally referred to as the Harmonized \nSystem or simply HS, is a multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs Organization.\n11 It comprises about 5,000 commodity groups, each identified by a six-digit code, \narranged in a legal and logical structure, and it is supported by well-defined rules to achieve uniform classification.\nThe system is used by more than 200 countries and economies as a basis for their customs tariffs and for \nthe collection of international trade statistics. Over 98 per cent of the merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the Harmonized System.\n6.2. How to select product codes\nAll measures should be matched with Harmonized System product codes. UNCTAD will provide the respective classifications in the TRAINS Data Entry Tool. The tool will record the measures affecting products at the Harmonized System\u2013level (six digits). Often, affected products correspond to more than one Harmonized System code item. A Harmonized System code may be used at the two-, four- or six-digit level only if all tariff lines within the selected code are affected by a measure. \nExample: Harmonized System code 0201 \u201cMeat of bovine animals, fresh or chilled\u201d may be used only if all Harmonized System six-digit products within it (that is, 020110 \u201cFresh or chilled bovine carcasses and half carcasses\u201d, 020120 \u201cOther cuts with bone in\u201d and 020130 \u201cBoneless\u201d are all affected by the measure.\nNormally, the regulation does not provide product codes but a description of the product. It may give a general description, which may not correspond to the Harmonized System six-digit code description. Therefore, it is important that the original text describing the affected products be preserved and recorded in the database for checking and updating purposes.\nThe data collector should register the description of the products affected by the measure in both the \noriginal language (the language in which the regulation is written) and English. This facilitates tracking the correspondence between the System codes assigned to the products and the description of the products. \nThe data collector may also use some product groups that are often found in the trade regulations and \nthat UNCTAD makes available in the TRAINS Data Entry Tool. These groups comprise many System codes, often from different chapters. In order to facilitate the work, UNCTAD has assigned corresponding System codes for those product groups, which can be consulted by clicking on \u201cSelect from Product Groups\u201d in the \u201cAffected Products\u201d form in the TRAINS Data Entry Tool. The most frequently used product groups in trade regulations are as follows:\n\u2022Agricultural products\n\u2022Dangerous chemicals\n\u2022Fish products and fresh or chilled fish\n\u2022Fishery products\n\u2022Food products\n\u2022Foodstuffs of non-animal origin\n11More information about the Harmonized System is available online at www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/\noverview/what-is-the-harmonized-system.aspx (accessed 20 February 2023).30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3240, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6747bed-024b-4d6d-899d-a2866247b271": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6747bed-024b-4d6d-899d-a2866247b271", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f73f4d9b-5060-4016-89d5-6f5e606579b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "13880f6e2d9022c2e1e027a1e0ecf0edf555c874ae3f6759261111730736bc8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022Fresh fruit and vegetables\n\u2022Iron and steel products\n\u2022Meat products and fresh or chilled meat\n\u2022Ozone-depleting products (Montreal Protocol)\n\u2022Ozone-depleting substances (Montreal Protocol)\n\u2022Poultry meat\n\u2022Textile products\n\u2022Narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances (Narcotics Convention)\n\u2022Endangered species (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \nFlora)\n\u2022Chemical weapons (Chemical Weapons Convention)\n\u2022Alcoholic beverages\n\u2022Hazardous chemicals and pesticides (Rotterdam Convention)\n\u2022Persistent organic pollutants (Stockholm Convention)\n\u2022Radioactive substances\nThese product groups are by no means exhaustive, and the list will be expanded as more groups of products are identified.\nThe data collector can also create their own product groups to facilitate the coding process, in case \ncertain sets of products are mentioned multiple times in the dataset.

One very useful tool is the Eurostat Combined Nomenclature Search Engine:\n\u2022Go to https://eurostat.prod.3ceonline.com/\n\u2022Search for keywords and specify further details in the online tool in order to identify product codes; the tool is only available in English\n\u2022It can be searched by word or browsing\nImportant note: Use this tool only to identify products down to the six-digit level. Codes with more digits refer to the tariff line level of the European Union, not the country of data collection. For UNCTAD NTM data collection, only the six-digit Harmonized System code will be recorded for the affected products.\n6.4 Principles for the use of \u201cpartial product coverage\u201d\nThe products indicated in a regulation are sometimes very specific and the Harmonized System does not always provide the necessary detail to appropriately classify them. In some cases, such details need to be further specified as \u201cpartial coverage\u201d of registered product codes. However, the use of partial product coverage should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. The following principles and examples provide guidance.\n31 6.

For the corresponding product codes for textiles, partial coverage should be indicated. The exception should be explained in the field that appears to the right of the \u201cpartial coverage\u201d indication \u2013 for example, \u201cexcept folklore textiles\u201d.\n(ii) Products may be affected only if they are used for certain purposes. Product codes may be identified, but the measure is applied only if the product has a specific use or application.\nExample 1: Plastics that come into contact with food must comply with certain purity requirements.

The reason should be explained in the field that appears to the right of the \u201cpartial coverage\u201d indication \u2013 for example, \u201capplied only to materials supposed to be in contact with food\u201d. \nExample 2: There is an importer registration requirement for hemp seeds not intended for sowing.

However, the wording of regulations is often negative, referring to a prohibition unless certain conditions are fulfilled. This should not be confused with a prohibition of a subset of the respective products, and this subset should not be indicated as partial product coverage. Instead, the adequate code should be selected to define the import conditions. The affected products are accordingly registered without partial product coverage.\nExample: A regulation prohibits the import of refrigerators and freezers that contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). \nWrong Right\nIt is incorrect to specify the measure \u201cprohibition for TBT reasons\u201d (B11) with a \u201cpartial product coverage\u201d indicating \u201conly those containing CFCs\u201d. \nThe word \u201cprohibits\u201d is misleading in \nthis case, as imports are allowed under the specified condition.This measure should be interpreted as \u201crestricted use of certain substances\u201d (B22), applied to all refrigerators and freezers:\nFull coverage of HS codes 841810, \n841821, 841829, 841830 and 841840.\n(e)  Group all measures with the same requirement for multiple products \nRegulations are sometimes very detailed and list the same (or very similar) requirements multiple times for multiple products. Instead of registering each of them separately, the data collector should group them all in a single measure and list all affected products. \nIf all the products jointly conform to a product group \u2013 for example, at the System\u2019s four-digit level \u2013 then \nthe group should be selected. Otherwise, they should be registered individually. \nExample 1: A decree sets the maximum level of bacteria allowed in yogurt (code 040310) and the maximum level of bacteria allowed in buttermilk, curdled milk and cream, kephir, other fermented milk, cream (code 040390).

Registering affected countries\n(a)  Identifying the countries of origin to which the measure applies\nIn most cases, non-tariff measures follow the principle of non-discrimination and apply to all countries. \n\u201cWorld\u201d is then registered as an affected region in the data.\nHowever, there are exceptions: (i)  Only certain countries are included:  If a measure only affects certain countries, only these should be \nregistered. The data collector indicates the affected countries by choosing a country, multiple countries, or \na region in the TRAINS Data Entry Tool (in the \u201cMeasure\u201d form). This implies that the rest of the world is not affected by the measure. If a list of countries is included in the regulation, this insertion is straightforward. The Tool also allows the data collector to insert the implementation date and repeal date for each selected country if the measure applies with different timelines in certain countries. Should the regulation refer not to a specific list of countries but to certain characteristics or criteria about the affected countries, the relevant domestic authorities should be contacted for clarification.\nExample: A regulation prohibits banana imports from countries where the oriental fruit fly ( Bactrocera/\nDacus dorsalis) exists. However, the regulation does not contain a list of affected countries. It is therefore necessary to contact the authorities, in this case the Ministry of Agriculture, to obtain a current list of countries to which the measure applies. It is important to inquire with domestic authorities, as they alone can confirm a list that is actually used at the border of the country. The source of the information obtained should then be indicated clearly in the \u201cNotes\u201d field under the \u201cAffected Products\u201d form of the TRAINS Data Entry Tool.\n(ii) Some countries are excluded:  In the data template, the exempted countries should be selected \nunder \u201cAffected countries\u201d in the TRAINS Data Entry Tool and also registered as \u201cis excluded\u201d. This implies that the measure applies to all other countries, except the ones ticked as \u201cis excluded\u201d.\nExample 1: Countries of origin that belong to the same regional trade agreement as the importing country may be exempted from certain additional taxes or certification requirements. Another example is the SPS measure \u201cgeographical restrictions on eligibility\u201d (A12). Such restrictions are imposed on all countries until a country proves that it complies with certain levels of protection against health hazards. Countries that have proved their eligibility are included in a so-called positive list. This list corresponds to registering the respective countries as \u201cis excluded\u201d. Should such a \u201cpositive list\u201d not be found in the regulation, the relevant authorities must be contacted for clarification.\nExample 2: When a group of countries is excluded from the measure \u2013 for example, non-parties to a \ncertain convention or non-EU European countries, that group should be selected (if it is not already in the list, then the group of members/parties should be created) and \u201cis excluded\u201d should be ticked.\n(b)  Export-related measures: registering destination countries\nAgain, in most cases, export-related measures apply to all exports irrespective of the destination country. \u201cWorld\u201d should then be registered as the affected region.\nIf the measure only affects certain destination countries, they must be specified by assigning them to \nthe list of countries/regions affected by the measure. If some destinations \u2013 for example, as a result of a regional trade agreement \u2013 are excluded, they are listed as \u201cis excluded\u201d. 36", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3714, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "517eb7db-97f1-4772-8e04-b9f658636405": {"__data__": {"id_": "517eb7db-97f1-4772-8e04-b9f658636405", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64b68cb-6666-4a9a-91dd-9352a316db98", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "68e34c53be0474b1295ad58ba6821099a06589b67f1016f99b5c995ab78bb5e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Example: Exports of arms to certain countries \u2013 for example, Somalia \u2013 are prohibited through \nembargoes (\u201cexport prohibition\u201d (P31)).

Introduction to the website \nTRAINS is a real-time collaborative application that encompasses the entry, validation, and dissemination \nof data on trade regulations and non-tariff measures (NTMs) into a single online data system. The central features of the new online interface are user-friendliness and productivity. The newly developed TRAINS Data Entry Tool (https://trainsdataentry.unctad.org/) serves as an interface for data entry and validation. Published data can be easily accessed by the public on the TRAINS Portal (https://trainsonline.unctad.org/).  \nData entry  \nUsers can register new regulations/NTMs data and maintain existing data through a user-friendly online interface. Moreover, the website can integrate data provided by other partner organizations.\nData validation \nUsers can quickly and efficiently verify the accuracy and correctness of registered NTM codes through user-friendly online dashboards and a circular revision system.  \nData dissemination  \nPublic users across the globe can access NTMs data easily and benefit from efficient search queries, data compilation, and data retrieval. They can also download customized search results.  \n2.  Different user roles  \nThe TRAINS Data Entry Tool assigns role-based access control to different types of users. This enables fine-grained control over user permissions and responsibilities, both for internal and external users. Only registered and approved users of the online tool have access to the website.  \nThe following four different user roles are available on the TRAINS Data Entry Tool and will interact with \neach other to conduct the data collection and validation work.  \nData collector  \nResponsibilities: 1) Identify sources for collecting trade regulations. 2) Collect regulations and record all associated regulation-level information. 3) Identify measures (NTMs) and record all associated measure-level information. \nData collection supervisor  \nResponsibilities: 1) Validate measure-level information for completeness, correctness, and relevance. 2) Conduct overall dataset quality checks: - Identify and remove duplicates - Check whether measures are out of scope - Check if the regulations and measures collected are comprehensive. 3) Give green light to publish the dataset. \nHS coder  \nResponsibilities: Operating at measure level, be responsible for the conversion of the Affected Product Description free text into a list of Product Codes (HS Codes).44", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2588, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9d98cdd-bf8f-4824-9ecd-192ac033f616": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9d98cdd-bf8f-4824-9ecd-192ac033f616", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eefeaa70-6481-484e-99f3-f45d698b7a5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\ditctab2023d4_en.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2581330, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "ce546c87746678ab1d25e071505af83aa0ea8a63ed03247d3780ed850c700702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HS code supervisor  \nResponsibilities: Validate the part of the measure-level information that refers to the list of product codes \n(HS Codes) for completeness, correctness, and relevance. \n3.

Data collector \n4.1.1. Data collection (for the first time) \nStep 1: Log in to https://trainsdataentry.unctad.org/ using your credentials. \nStep 2: Go to the My Data page (from the navigation menu). Here you can see all datasets that are \nassigned to your role, as well as their status (Data collection, Submit for publication, Published, Data processing, Data update, and Archived). You can only collect data for datasets that are in the \u201cData collection\u201d or \u201cData update\u201d state. \nStep 3: To start registering regulations for a dataset, click on \u201cView regulations\u201d for that dataset ( i.e. data \ncollection in Canada). You will then be directed to the List of Regulations page where you can create new \nregulations or edit/view all existing regulations registered for a specific dataset. \nStep 4: Create a new regulation by clicking on \u201c+New regulation\u201d. You will land on the \u201cRegulation form\u201d \nwhere you can upload collected regulations and register all relevant regulation-level information.

Data update  \nUpdating NTM data makes it possible to capture the changes that regulations and their measures undergo over time in a given country. The TRAINS Data Entry Tool will keep track of the regulations and measures before and after updates.  \nStep 1: Log in to https://trainsdataentry.unctad.org/ using your credentials. Step 2: Go to the My Data page (from the navigation menu). Here you will see all datasets that are assigned \nto your role, as well as their status (Data Collection, Submit for Publication, Published, Data Processing, Data Update and Archived). The datasets that require an update will have the status \u201cData update\u201d. \nStep 3: Drawing from the stock of existing regulations of a country\u2019s past NTM data collection ( i.e. Canada \nin this example), you will have to identify which regulations are unchanged, or have been amended or \nrepealed at the time of the data update. Moreover, you can also correct past mistakes and identify new sources of regulations and measures.  \nThis leaves you with four sources of variation of NTM data over time:  \na. New regulation: the regulation is entirely new and does not change nor repeal an already existing \nregulation;  \nb.  Amended regulation: the regulation is an amendment modifying an already existing regulation;  \nc.  Repealed regulation: the regulation is repealing an already existing regulation;  \nd. Corrected regulation: the regulation is corrected for mistakes in the previous round of data collection. \na. New regulation  \nWhen a regulation is entirely new and does not amend any regulation already collected, you should follow the same process as for collecting measures for the first time, which is described in Section 4.1.1 (steps 3-10). \nb. Amended regulation \nStep 1: You should click on the button \u201c+ New Regulation\u201d. \nStep 2: You should link the amendment to the original regulation by selecting the original regulation from \nthe \u201cThis Regulation amends\u201d list.\nStep 3: You should fill out the information of the amendment regulation and click on \u201cSave as complete\u201d. \nPlease note that only regulations with all measures in either the \u201cApproved\u201d or \u201cPublished\u201d state can be selected from the list.

Non-tariff measures (NTMs), however, represent a growing challenge for exporters and policy makers. The ability to gain and to benefit from market access depends increasingly on compliance with trade regulatory measures such as sanitary requirements and goods standards.\r\n\r\nUNCTAD has been actively involved in research and activities on issues related to non-tariff measures. In 1994, UNCTAD began to collect and classify the measures. While the UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) remains the most comprehensive database on the measures, it has required substantial improvements to keep up with the increasing complexity of and need for data.\r\n\r\nTo develop a strategy to reduce the transparency gap, in 2006, UNCTAD established the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-Tariff Barriers, composed of leading economists from international organizations.\r\n\r\nA Multi-Agency Support Team (MAST group) provided substantial support. As a result, the Transparency in Trade initiative was launched by UNCTAD, the African Development Bank, the International Trade Centre and the World Bank. UNCTAD leads international efforts to collect data on the measures.\r\n\r\nThe collection of these data requires the classification of legal documents (regulations, directives, rules and the like) by appropriate predefined codes. These codes are provided in the publication International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the measures was developed and agreed by several international organizations in the context of a multi-agency initiative led by UNCTAD (MAST group: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Trade Centre (ITC), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), UNCTAD, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO)) and international experts.\r\n\r\nThe classification is designed to facilitate the collection, analysis and dissemination of data on the measures, with the final objective of increasing transparency and understanding about the subject.\r\n\r\nA recurring problem for data collectors, who collect and classify trade-related regulations into non-tariff measures data, is that regulations on the measures are often based on legal and/or technical terms which may render it difficult to unequivocally assign the most appropriate code. For data collectors, some interpretation is often required when classifying the measures described in the legal documents and regulations according to the predefined codes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this manual is to provide guidelines to enable data collectors to harmonize the data collection process and to minimize uncertainty during the process of categorization and classification. In doing so, the manual presents the logic behind the classification of non-tariff measures, and it explains how to choose the most appropriate code.\r\n\r\nThis manual provides a large set of examples, and it is regularly updated to respond to queries and questions emerging during the data collection exercise. This 2023 version updates the last version prepared in 2021.\r\n\r\nThis manual has been created with the intention of covering as many cases as possible. However, if uncertainties persist, data collectors are encouraged to submit their questions to ntm@unctad.org, providing also a copy of the legal text and stating the proposed code.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3688, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53b57db5-f492-48cc-b37c-e76f44105993": {"__data__": {"id_": "53b57db5-f492-48cc-b37c-e76f44105993", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\what are ntms.txt", "file_name": "what are ntms.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 506, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ffa11364-c711-4e6d-aa09-76a90278fa2f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\fab\\Documents\\projects\\2024-10-18_\\data\\what are ntms.txt", "file_name": "what are ntms.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 506, "creation_date": "2024-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-18"}, "hash": "b8a90d43da074e561f6b9c041a48e7d4958b92c911bc0de45c766b28ba8e3d3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "What are Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs)?\r\nNon-tariff measures (NTMs) are policy measures other than tariffs that can potentially have an economic effect on international trade in goods.
